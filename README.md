# Click Outside Modal

This is a simple demo to show click-outside-modal-to-close functionality with vanilla JavaScript.

Things I learned while building this:

- Smooth animation via CSS properties and event listeners,
- A great trick of finding outside click through .closest() function,
- And, finally, how to put everything together.
